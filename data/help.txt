The time of initial state calculation is usually set between 100-1000 fs.
The larger the value, the slower the calculation.

The electronic stopping potential is much less accurate than the repulsive 
potential; therefore, if the simulated range distribution appears to be 
shifted in one direction, the electronic stopping is scaled. Here are some 
examples of the scaling (Molecular dynamics simulations of atomic 
collisions for ion irradiation experiments, K. Nordlund, Acta Polytechnica 
Scandinavica (Applied physics series 202)).

He->Ta					1.4
He->Nb					1.0
He->W					1.1
He->AISI 316L (stainless steel)		1.0

If you have no information of the domain size, try making it BIG (>50000Å)

To enable easy debugging two debug options are incorporated
in the program. Ordinary debug mode is implemented with the command
line option "-d". It prints out to standard output and standard error
the values of a number of important variables during run-time.
Variables from within the loop over time steps are not printed out
for each time step to prevent the number of output data from  
becoming too large. In maximum debug mode (selected with "-dm")
variables from within the loop over time steps along with a large
number of other information is printed out.
Apart from outright debugging the debug modes can also be used
to obtain a number of physical quantities. For instance,
the temperature in the cell as a function of time in
the initial displacement calculation can be obtained with
the Unix command sequence

mdh -dm |& grep ^ini

With the options "-r", "-p" and "-pi" output of the recoil or
of all atom coordinates during runtime can be selected.
By piping the output of MDH to the drawing program dpc
this enables making simple on-line animations of atom movement
in the program.
