This is a sample run for 40 keV Ge ion implated in the random direction of crystalline Si, using
PENR stopping and spherically symmetric charge distributions for Si-atoms AND a DAMAGE BUILD-UP MODEL.
Fluence is 1e14 ions/cm^2.
There are no surface oxide.

This case here is accepted in publication in NIMB. The coordinate files are from full MD simulation of
amorphization of crystalline Si. 

The parameter files are:

param.in = all the key parameters
coords.in.1.0 = Si-layer as a (4*5.43 = 21.72 Å)^3 coordinate file with no damage (Dose=0 eV per atom)
coords.in.1.1 = Si-layer as a (21.72 Å)^3 coordinate file with some damage (Dose=0.7534 eV per atom)
                The real size of the box is marked in the "O x y z" line. That is why the 
	        param.in-file contains the "*scaling"-lines.
...

coords.in.1.19 = Si-layer as a (21.72 Å)^3 coordinate file with full damage (total amorphization) 

stopping.in = Stopping vs. one-electronic-radius for the second layer, because we have 
	      set the elstop to 1 (PENR-model) for that layer. This file is calculated 
	      with density functional methods and is valid ONLY for the Ge-ion.
cdens.in = charge density (e/Å^3) vs. r (Å). This is the Hartee-Fock spherical-symmetric 
	   charge density profile for Si atoms, used by the PENR-model. This profile is 
	   taken from ZBL-book Vol.1.
reppot.0.1.in = The repulsive pair-potential part between Si and Ge atoms, calculated 
	        with DMol-package.

The .orig files and the output file are the ones that we have simulated (with just these 
input files) , so you can compare your simulations with theses files.
