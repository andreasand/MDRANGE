This is a sample run for 15 keV B ion implated in the <100> channel of
crystalline Si, using PENR stopping and spherically symmetric charge
distributions for Si-atoms.  There is a 16.29 ≈ thick layer of SiO2 in
the surface.

The parameter files are:

param.in = all the key parameters
coords.in.1 = the first layer (SiO2) as a (16.29 ≈)^3 coordinate file
coords.in.2 = the second layer (Si) as a (16.29 ≈)^3 coordinate file
elstop.in.1 = ZBL-electronic stopping file as Stopping vs. velocity for the first layer 
stopping.in = Stopping vs. one-electronic-radius for the second layer, because we have 
	      set the elstop to 1 (PENR-model) for that layer. This file is calculated 
	      with density functional methods and is valid ONLY for the B-ion.
cdens.in = charge density (e/≈^3) vs. r (≈). This is the Hartee-Fock spherical-symmetric 
	   charge density profile for Si atoms, used by the PENR-model. This profile is 
	   taken from ZBL-book Vol.1.
reppot.0.1.in = The repulsive pair-potential part between Si and B atoms, calculated 
	        with DMol-package.

The .orig files and the output file are the ones that we have simulated
(with just these input files) , so you can compare your simulations with
theses files.
