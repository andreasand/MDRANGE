Here are the tools for calculating the electron density of a Si unicell.
The coordinates of the unitcell are in the file "5unitcell.Si", which consist of 5x5x5
unitcells, of which the middle one is used for the electron density calculations. This is
because the density must be periodic over the unitcell borders.

"ctot" calculates the electron density in to a file "cdensity.dat" in e/Å^3 and
with coordinates in to a file "cdensreal.dat" in format x y z dens, where x,y,z are the 
coordinates inside the middle unitcell.

"rsconvert" transforms the densities of the "cdensity.dat" to a form used in the MDRANGE
in to a file "chargedens_rs.in". Use this file as a "charge.in" when running MDRANGE!

Note 1. Using the PENR stopping with the total electron density profile  
gives the same
results as using Firsov stopping (elstop->Firsov:= 1 in param.in) and only 3p electron 
density profile. 
(At least for the low energy cases of B,As,P, which are tested). The 3p density profile 
is calculated by using parameter "3p" when using ctot: ctot 3p

Note 2. There are known problems with the too long channeling tails in the 110 channel 
when simulating range profiles. This can be partly corrected by using a correction factor
with the 3p-density (+Firsov of course). Use this correction as:  
  cat chargedens_rs.in | correction 0.06 1 1 > corrected_chargedens_rs.in
and use the "corrected_chargedens_rs.in" as the file "charge.in" when using MDRANGE. 

(This correction is going to be published as J Peltola, K. Nordlund
and J. Keinonen, "Electronic stopping power calculation method for
molecular dynamics simulations using local elastic and inelastic contributions, 
Rad. Eff. & Def in Sol. submitted (2004).
