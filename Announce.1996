    Dear MDRANGE user !

  This email has been sent to people who, according to my notes, at some 
point have acquired or showed interest in MDRANGE. If you are no longer
interested in the subject/code, a brief reply telling that will make me 
remove you from my list of MDRANGE users.

  This mail announces the arrival of a new package of the code.
It includes a new dialog-like setup program mdsetup , which
makes it quite easy to create the input files for the actual
simulation code mdh. Also part of the package is a code which
evaluates the SRIM96 electronic stopping powers, so all 
required input files can now be generated online.

  The package also contains slightly improved documentation
and six sets of sample input files for mdh. The mdh code itself
has also been somewhat enhanced; in particular, the initial atom
displacements can now be obtained very quickly using a Debye
temperature based algorithm.

  The package can be obtained by anonymous ftp from

ftp://beam.helsinki.fi/pub/knordlun/mdrange.tar.gz

  which can be unpacked the usual way, using eg.

gunzip mdrange.tar.gz
tar xvf mdrange.tar

  It should work on any Unix platform, and has been explicitly 
tested on Alpha, Linux, AIX, SGI, HP, SGI and Sun Unix platforms.

	Yours,
