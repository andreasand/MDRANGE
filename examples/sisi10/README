  This directory contains the minimal mdh input file; all default
parameter values except the incident angle are used. This amounts
to a 10 keV Si -> c-Si simulation, with the universal ZBL 
repulsive potential, and initial atomic displacements calculated
from the Mazzone potential at 300 K.

  The electronic stopping power is an experimental Si -> Si stoppping 
power measured at the Accelerator Laboratory at the University
of Helsinki [J. Keinonen et. al., APL 60 (1992) 228].
