  15 keV As -> multilayer Si (20 A random surface layer)

  First 20 A form an amorphous Si surface layer:
	- Default is a 216 atom amorphous bulk Si structure from ab initio
	  MD simulations, in the file coords.in.1 (coords.in.1.abini216)
	- You can replace coords.in.1 with coords.in.1.random216, which 
          contains a truly random 216 atom structure (the only criterion used 
          in creating it was that no atom was supposed to be closer than 
	  2.3 A from any other)
	
  Rest of the sample is crystalline. 

  You can easily modify the width of the surface amorphous layer by 
  changing the minz and maxz parameters in param.in; note that both
  the first layer minz and second layer maxz must be modified.

  ZBL Universal repulsive potential

  Electronic stopping power is the same for both layers.
  
  THE DEFAULT INPUT FILES HAVE NOW BEEN CHECKED AND SHOULD BE OK
  (see notes below).

  Note that real amorphous Si has a lower density than 
  crystalline Si. Therefore, you might want to remove some
  atoms from coords.in.1 to get the desired density.

  For theta=0°, using the default amorphous structure does not
give a proper range profile: the 63 atom cell has channels in 100...

  Range results for theta=phi=0°:

Amorphous layer		_    _
thickness (maxz)	R ± dR		Notes
---------------		-------		------
None			880 ± 30	Crystalline 64 atom cell only
None			750 ± 20	Crystalline 216 atom cell only
0 Å 			450 ± 20	coords.in.1.abini 
0 Å 			375 ± 18	216 atom cells used
20 Å			376 ± 16	debyet removed, coords.in.1.random
20 Å			338 ± 12	debyet removed, 216 atom cells used
10000 Å (infinite)	420 ± 20	coords.in.1.abini 
10000 Å (infinite)	510 ± 20	coords.in.1.random
10000 Å (infinite)	167 ± 2		debyet removed,	coords.in.1.random
10000 Å (infinite)	215 ± 8	 	216 atom cells used
10000 Å (infinite)	163 ± 2		debyet removed, 216 atom cells used
10000 Å (infinite)	166 ± 4		debyet removed, coords.in.random216

  When debyet is not used for the amorphous layer, the initial
state simulation causes the amorphous structure to lose its shape,
making it even more random. Therefore, the 216 atom cells and
no debyet is the best choice, and was made the default.

  Note that using maxz=0 for the amorphous layer is not the
same as using a purely crystalline cell; maxz=0 still gives
the very first atom layer as amorphous.
