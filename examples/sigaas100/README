  This directory contains a sample input for 100 keV Si -> GaAs
implantation. The present input files are for implantation
straight into the 100 channel. For other angles, change
the reccalc->Fii and Theta variables. E.g. for a 'random'
direction try 

reccalc->Fii0:= 30      # Azimuth angle of the recoil atom
reccalc->Fiimax:= 30    # is chosen randomly from [Fii0,Fiimax]
reccalc->Theta0:= 7     # Polar angle of the recoil atom
reccalc->Thetamax:= 7   # is chosen randomly from [Theta0,Thetamax]

  To start  a simulation, just issue the mdh command in this
directory. 


  The interatomic potentials are ab initio potentials calculated
using the DMol package which should be quite accurate. The
electronic stopping power elstop.in.expt is an experimental stopping 
power for Si in Ge. We have found that ions in Ge an GaAs have 
almost exactly the same stopping, so this stopping should
be applicable for Si in GaAs as well. Note that the method
used to determine the stopping has the highest uncertainty
at low energies. Still, the stopping should be better than what
TRIM gives.

  More information can be found in the following references.
Please cite these references if you publish any work using
the repulsive potential and/or the electronic stopping
power (considerable work has been put into obtaining them).
