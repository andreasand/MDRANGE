# MDRANGE
This is a molecular dynamics -based code for calculating ion ranges.


   VERSIONS

  mdrange has been developed in two major steps. The first one
was by Kai Nordlund in 1994-2001. The second step contained a
range of major physical additions as well as some changes in the
basic algorithms by Jarkko Peltola in 2001- [5,9]. The version numbering
up to 1.83b are Kai Nordlund's versions, from 1.83b up to 3.X
Jarkko Peltolas [39,58,78,92]. The first versions are for short called "mdh1",
the latter ones "mdh3". The main binary is called "mdh", as before.

  Also in this distribution is a special rare-event enhanced
version, compiled to the binary called mdhreed.
Furthermore, the last "mdh1" version by Kai Nordlund is provided
in the directory mdh1/mdh/. This is to enable checking that the
new additions are not in discrepancy with possible previous uses
of the program. They should not be, but caveat emptor.

  A detailed list of the version history is in mdh/modification_history
